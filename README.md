# Cryptographic Algorithms
Various Cryptographic Algorithms made using python.

## Prerequisites:
Make sure that you have the following:
-  Python 3+ and pip (which comes with Python 3+)
-  Some requires different libraries so be sure to install before run
-  An environment to work in - something like Jupyter or Spyder

## Terms:
-  E denotes Encryption
-  D denotes Decryption
-  Some have both E&D and some have only E.
